# HSL Near Me



## Developing

First, get HSL api key from digitransit.fi and add it as `DIGITRANSIT_API_KEY` environment value to `.env` file. See [Svelte documentation](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/env-static-private) for more information.

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
